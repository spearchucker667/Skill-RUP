# Session Summary

## Accomplishments
Successfully remediated the conversion of `RUP Protocol v3.0.0` into the portable, agent-native skill `Skill-RUP`. The implementation now strictly enforces real checks, removing all stubs, mocks, and fabricated data from the initial implementation.

Key Remediations Completed:
1. **Security & Data Integrity**:
   - Fixed P0 path jail vulnerability (`enforce_path_jail`) in `runtime/security.py` by implementing path-aware `relative_to()` constraints.
   - Fixed P1 state persistence in `runtime/state.py` to use atomic tempfile writes (`os.replace`) to prevent file corruption.
2. **Authentic Capability & Workflow Extraction**:
   - Rewrote extraction scripts (`build_capability_map.py`, `generate_workflows.py`, `generate_schemas_templates.py`) to directly parse the canonical `rup-protocol.yaml` and `rup-schema.json`, pulling in real capabilities, processes, and types instead of hardcoded placeholders.
3. **Genuine Runtime Execution**:
   - `runtime/discovery.py` & `runtime/inventory.py`: Implemented real file tree walking for LOC calculation and actual gap evaluation (missing CI, missing tests, missing README).
   - `runtime/planning.py`: Updated backlog generation to map directly to the genuine gaps identified.
   - `runtime/execution.py` & `runtime/verification.py`: Hooked up real `git` subprocess commands for diff/commit detection, and implemented real subprocess execution for test suites (e.g. `pytest`) to determine pass/fail criteria instead of faking results.
4. **Testing & CI Documentation**:
   - `scripts/forward_test.py` was rewritten to genuinely invoke the full CLI lifecycle (`python3 -m runtime.cli`) rather than mocking test success.
   - Updated `.github/workflows/` with fully functional execution rules running `pytest` and schema validation.
   - Wrote legitimate `README.md`, `INSTALL.md`, and `USER_GUIDE.md` files while deleting deprecated references.
   - Updated provenance `manifest.json` generation to calculate genuine git blob hashes (`git hash-object`) instead of leaving SHAs "UNKNOWN".

## Validation Results
- **Forward Integration Tests**: PASS (All Python unit tests under `pytest tests/` execute correctly with real state generation).
- **Forward Script Tests**: PASS (`python3 scripts/forward_test.py --fixtures .` successfully passes all lifecycle CLI executions).
- **Canonical Schema Conformance**: PASS (Outputs adhere flawlessly to schema structures via `validate_rup.py`).

## Open Blockers
- None. The skill implementation successfully implements real-world behavior and schema compliance without any fabricated logic.

## Next Actions
- Ready for integration and distribution.
